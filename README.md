Here I learned how to access and manipulate APIs to dynamically display on the page as well as verfiy information. On this page you will see that you can look up the stock logo, name, current price and recent news articles on any given stock symbol already displayed on the page by clicking on the cooresponding button. If there is a stock you'd like to see that isn't listed,  you can add a button that will display that stock's information. 

Additionally, you can only add stock symbols that exist currently in the stock market. Lastly, each stock symbol you add will automatically format to all uppercase regardless of how you type it. 

I had a lot of fun making this assignment, I find APIs very cool and interesting to play with . Some struggles I found were dynamically adding event listeners to each button- but thanks to the help of a fellow classmate I was able to understand how that works and make some awesome buttons!
